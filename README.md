# Data-Science-Projects

In this repository I present my data science projects.

## Data Science: Statistics and Machine Learning Specialization by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera

* EDA_nlp.pdf - [Milestone report](https://rpubs.com/kitazharov/573608): Exploratory data analysis, data cleaning and preprocessing for 4-gram language model algorithm. (Final Capstone Project milestone report)
* [Report](https://mykytazharov.github.io/personalActivityPrediction/) - Predictive analysis and modeling of personal activity in R. 
* [R Shiny App](https://mykytazharov.shinyapps.io/KMeansVisualisation/ ) for solving clustering problem for the iris data set using K-means, K-medoids, mode-based clustering algorithms.
* [R Shiny App](https://mykytazharov.shinyapps.io/SmartKeyBoardApp/) for predicting the next word the user intends to type, based in the 4-gram language model with stupid backoff algorithm. (Final Capstone Project)
